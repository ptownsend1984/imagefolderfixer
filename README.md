Helper application to help me organize pictures from my phone.

Version 1.0 groups photos by year and then month. It will attempt to use the date taken from the Exif if available. The fallback is the last write date, which miraculously is not lost when copying the pictures off of the phone.

### How do I get set up? ###

Built using Visual Studio 2015. No external packages required.
